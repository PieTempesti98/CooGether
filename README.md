# CooGether
##### Project work for Large Scale and Multi-Structured Databases course developed by Irene Cantini, Federica Perrone and Pietro Tempesti

## What is CooGether
Coogether is social network where people can excange, comment and review their recipes. Users can also follow each other in order to be updated about the latest publications of their favourite posters.

The application provides also some different filters designed to filter and sort the recipes following a wide range of parameters.

## Project features
This application is a desktop app written in Java, using JavaFX to build the GUI.
The persistent storage is based on a MongoDB remote cluster and a Neo4j remote database; the consistency between the two databases is handled by the java code.

Furter informations about the architecture and the designo of the application are available in the documentation provided inside the repository.

_All the databases were hosted in the University of Pisa's network, now they are not reachable so the application is not running._
